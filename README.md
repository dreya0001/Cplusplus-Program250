Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program is a crucial aspect of creating successful software applications. User needs refer to the specific requirements, expectations, and goals of the end-users. Creating the user stories helped with making sure that the flow of the story is being implemented the correct way. I feel the user stories help me continue the process of what needs to be done. User stories facilitate communication between development teams, stakeholders, and users, ensuring that everyone is on the same page about the software's purpose and functionality.

Approaching program development involves a systematic and iterative process that encompasses various stages from planning to deployment. Incorporating Agile processes into your development work can enhance collaboration, adaptability, and product quality. I also really enjoy the agile process, I feel that in my career I am in now it would be very helpful for me to use this process to complete work in a more effiecent way. I want to incorperate the entire process, we have already started with the meetings. 

Being a good team member in software development goes beyond technical skills and involves a combination of collaboration, communication, professionalism, and a commitment to producing high-quality software.
